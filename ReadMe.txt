Project: ChoateBooks - website that allows choate students to sell or trade textbooks. 

Students create accounts to post textbooks or find which ones to buy. Using the Search bar they can easily find the book they need. In the end, I think it was best if the person that wants to buy the book uses the email in the post and contact them directly. I don't think I am able to do only transactions just yet. This project made me revist html and css which was fun as I haven't done it in a long time. This project was fun because I never realized I could be able to create a website that you need to log in to. I thought that was only possible if you had your own paid domain or if you are an expert in computer science. Xampp and php were interesting to learn about just through this project, I hope to learn more about it.

Peer review:
	Y. W. (note:this was before the css)
		- I like the concept
		- needs to look better lol
		- maybe add a navigation bar for the user so that they dont have to click the back arrow to go back a lot of times

	S. H.
		- The photo in the background for the login page is good you should add it for the other pages too
		- make sure that only choate emails are accepted and not other email domains
		- can you make the buttons look better? they kind of dont match the theme

	**I was able to fix all of these problems
